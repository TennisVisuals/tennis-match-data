## Point-by-Point Files

Point-by-point data for tennis matches.  All matches have been validated using the [Universal Match Object](https://github.com/TennisVisuals/universal-match-object) to insure that point progressions produce scores that match  'official' scores.

Where possible, the format of these files follows the format established by [Jeff Sackmann's GitHub repository](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_pointbypoint).
